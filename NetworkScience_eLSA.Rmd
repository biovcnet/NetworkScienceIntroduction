Every time I ever run elsa, I look at the help file.

Here are some things to notice. You need to give it a datafile. We don't have any replicates in our datafile, thus "r" is going to be 1, and "s" is going to be our number of columns. So you'll have to count those somehow.

```{r}
arisa <- read.delim("SPOT/spotClrMtx.tsv", sep = "\t")
dim(arisa)
```

Easiest and most relyable to just load into R. We have 119 time point and 21 OTUs, so `s = 21`
also `-b` and `-t` also have do do with replicates, so we can set `-b` to `0`, and ignore `-t`

`dataFile` is our input
`resultFile` is our output

Other things. We've alredy interpolated our NA values, so `-f` doesn't matter, but if we had a few months of NA values that would matter. We've also prefiltered our data but if we hadn't we would want to specify `-m` to tell it how often something had to show up. We can set it to zero to do no more filtering.  Let me just try running it.

```{bash engine.opts='-i'}
conda activate elsa01
lsa_compute SPOT/spotClrMtx.tsv SPOT/spotClrMtx.out.csv -d 1 -m 0 -p theo -x 1000 -b 0 -r 1 -s 119 -n none
```

And now we have a super cryptic error.

```{bash engine.opts='-i'}
conda activate elsa01
lsa_compute -h
```
