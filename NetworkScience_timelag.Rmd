Lets bring in some time-series data from the SPOT dataset. These are ARISA fragements, their lengths associate with species identity. I downloaded the data here:

https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/535915

And then removed some variables that we are not using yet. 

The data set is somewhat large. To save space, I've zipped it.

Fortunately, R can read zipped csv files just fine.
Some of the months are missing arrisa data and are loaded in as "nd". We can remove those later, but we tell R so it doesn't freak out.

```{r}
spotAr <- read_csv("SPOT/spot_arisa.zip", na = "nd")
```
